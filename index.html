	<h2>Lesson 1: Learn from failure</h2>
	<p class="p-lesson">But then, does one failure mean that youâ€™re not good? Of course not! Especially, when you deal with it maturely and understand the reasons for a bad performance on a single occasion. The hare understood his folly and challenged the tortoise to another contest. This time he did not think low of his opponent but remained alert and energetic all through the race and won it.</p>

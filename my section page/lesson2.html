	<h2>Lesson 2: Identify your strengths and use them</h2>
	<p class="p-lesson">Now, can we say that the hare is better than the tortoise? Did the tortoise wallow in self-pity thinking how he can never be as fast as the hare? No. The tortoise realized that his strengths are different from those of the hare and that does not make him any less competent than the hare.
Hence, the tortoise challenged the hare once again this time for a contest, the condition being that he would decide the track conditions. The hare agreed. The race began and the hare took the lead, naturally. After crossing a short distance, the hare stopped mid-track, for what did he see? There was a small river that now spanned between him and the finishing line. Even as he wondered what to do under the circumstances, the tortoise caught up, crossed the river, and won the race in style.
